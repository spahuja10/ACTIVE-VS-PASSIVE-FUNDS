Performance Analysis of Actively Managed Funds vs Benchmark Indices (Python, Excel, PowerPoint)
Libraries used:
Pandas, Yfinance, Plotly, Matplotlib, Webbrowser, Threading, Dash
•	Leveraged Python (Pandas, Yfinance, Plotly, Dash) to analyze 10 years of data for FCNTX (active fund) and VOO (S&P 500 ETF), building an interactive dashboard to visualize returns, sector allocation, NAV, expense ratio, and standard deviation
•	Evaluated short-term and long-term performance, concluded active funds excel in security selection for short-term returns but underperform passive funds over the long term due to lower fees and market consistency
